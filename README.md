## ⚙️ How It Works

ChromiQ uses a sophisticated backend pipeline to transform an image into a beautiful and useful color palette:

1.  **Image Processing**: When an image is uploaded, the backend (built with Spring Boot) processes it, ensuring it's in a standard format and resized for optimal performance without sacrificing quality.
2.  **Color Extraction**: The application analyzes the image pixel by pixel, identifying every unique color and its frequency.
3.  **K-Means Clustering**: To make sense of potentially thousands of colors, ChromiQ uses a k-means clustering algorithm. This groups similar colors together, identifying the most statistically significant "dominant" colors.
4.  **Interactive API**: A RESTful API allows the frontend to communicate with the backend to generate the initial palette, and then add, remove, or replace colors based on user interactions.
